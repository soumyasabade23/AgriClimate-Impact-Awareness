SUB-THEME: IMPACTS OF CHANGING WEATHER AND CLIMATE CHANGE ON AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS AND FARMER AWARENESS

INTRODUCTION:  
Weather is the instantaneous state of the atmosphere, or sequence of states of the atmosphere with time, which can be defined as the condition of the atmosphere at any given time and place. Climate, on the other hand, is the average as well as variability of weather conditions prevailing in an area over a long period of time, known also as the Statistics of Weather. Precipitation, temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and wind are the important elements of weather and climate.
India’s weather and climate are mainly governed by her geographical location, surrounding boundary conditions (the Himalayas, the Indian Ocean, Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal). Further, the variations in land and water distribution within the country, altitudinal differences, vegetation type and cover along with the variations of sunshine hours within the country due to its latitudinal and longitudinal extension are clubbed together to divide the country into six climatic zones and twelve agro-climatic zones differing from each other quite significantly.  
The diversity in Indian climate systems and the occurrence of four distinct seasons in most parts of the country make the climate change study in India challenging. Due to the large extension of India both along north–south and west–east, different parts of the country experience different ranges of temperature and rainfall, even during the same month or season. During the four months from June to September, the southwest summer monsoon is the predominant weather system in the country and during October to December, the northeast winter monsoon along with the western disturbances controls the weather of the country in general. In addition, the extreme weather events in India have geographical heterogeneity. For example, cold waves, prolonged fog, snowfall, flash floods, etc. are mostly confined to the northern part; cyclonic storms, storm surges, heavy rainfall and floods are mostly observed in the coastal regions; heat waves, dry spells and droughts largely occur in Central India. In the last decade or so, heat waves have been more prevalent in states like Orissa and Andhra Pradesh on the east coast, and there are incidents of very heavy rainfall in Mumbai and Balmer in the west.
These climatic and agro-climatic zones are facing serious problems of various kinds due to the impact of climatic/ weather anomalies. For more than one decade weather and climatic anomalies are taking place in all the agro-climatic regions of the country. Moreover, one major element of climatic control in the country, the Indian Monsoon, was found to be altering in terms of its onset, amount and distribution of rainfall across the country, which clearly indicates probable impacts on the country’s economy.
Agriculture is a climate dependent economic activity. Hence, it is most vulnerable to weather and climate changes because of its seasonality and narrow range of weather conditions influencing crop and livestock production. Weather and climate are some of the biggest risk factors impacting on farming performance and management. Climate change presents a profound challenge to food security vis-à-vis livelihood and development all around as well. Climatic hazards like flood, drought, and snowfall have effects on agriculture and allied sectors in a numerous way.
Two-third agriculture in India is mainly rainfed and is highly dependent on the performance of monsoon and also it accounts for the 80% of the water supply. Depending upon the rainfall in different zones, different crops are grown. Different crops are also grown depending on the season and availability of water. 

AIMS AND OBJECTIVES: 
To study the impact of weather and climate change on agriculture. The various methods to increase the farmer’s awareness on the weather related information provided by different stake holders.

HYPOTHESIS: 
Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has projected that there will be an increase in extreme weather events like floods, droughts, heat and cold waves. These will further affect all stages of farming. The impact of weather on agriculture includes:
1.Rainfall which drives water availability and determines Sowing time (rainfed crops).
2.Temperature that drives crop growth.
3.Temperature, Relative Humidity influences pest and diseases incidence on crops.
4.Radiation influences the photosynthetic productivity.
5. Wet & dry spells cause significant impact on standing crops, physiology, loss of economic products (eg. fruit drop)
6. Extreme events (eg. high rainfall/floods/heat wave/cold wave/ cyclone / hail/ frost) cause enormous losses of standing crops,

WORK PLAN: 
Extreme weather and climate events such as severe droughts, floods, or temperature often shocks the farming community leading to decline in agricultural production, particularly in arid and semi-arid zones. Factors such as excessive rainfall variability and large change in temperature contribute to the vulnerability of individual farms, as well as on whole rural communities. 
The effects of different weather on farming in different cities in varied agro-climatic zones of are examined by various organization viz., ICAR (Indian council of Agricultural Research) and IMD (India Meteorological Department). The results obtained by ICAR are reproduced here under result section. Though there has been a tremendous effort to communicate to the farmers about the impending weather, there is a need to increase the interaction between the farmers and the Agro-Meteorological Service providing agencies.

METHODOLGY:
News articles, reports published by various research organizations were studied to understand the impact of changing weather on agricultural products. Feedbacks obtained from the farmers by IMD during an interactive session are compiled.

RESULTS: 

a] Impact of weather and climate change on crops:
Following were the impacts observed through modeling/ experimentation by ICAR:

1)Wheat is likely to be negatively impacted in rabi due to terminal heat stress.
2)Kharif crops to be impacted more by rainfall variability while rabi crops by 	minimum temperature.
3)Rice in the IGP to be impacted both by temperature and water availability.
4)Legume crops like soybean and groundnut are likely to be benefited due to 	increased temperature/CO2 if water availability is not limited.
5)More opportunities for rain water harvesting due to high intensity rainfall but 	greater loss of top soil due to erosion.

Overall impacts:
1)Negative impact on rice, wheat and horticulture.
2)Neutral or positive on some crops like soybean, groundnut, coconut, potato in some zones

Impacts on wheat and rice:
1)Reduce the irrigated wheat production by 6% Adaptation strategies can not only offset the production losses but can increase the yields.
2)Average simulated rainfed groundnut yields under current and future scenarios in major crop growing regions of India.

Impacts of Global climate change
1)Global climate change may raise production of potato in Punjab, Haryana and western and central UP by 3.46 to 7.11% in  2030 scenario, but in rest of India particularly West Bengal and plateau region potato production may decline by 4 to 16%.
2)Such climatic changes are likely to result in increased soybean yields by 8‐13%. Effect of climate change on groundnut is likely to be variable with yields varying between ‐5 and +7% as compared to current yields.
3)Shift in apple pp cultivation to higher elevations due to non fulfillment of chilling requirement.
4)Increase in temperature did not show any significant impact on productivity of other temperate fruits like Peach, Plum and Pear.
5)Unseasonal rainfall in March 2008 – cashew was affected.
6)The tea crop in mid hill regions also showed a decrease in yield with increasing temperature and decreasing rainfall.

b] Awareness programme and feedback from farmers:
1)Awareness programme conducted for the farmers gave a lot of insight on their requirements. It gave farmers a roadmap on how to utilize the forecast and advisories, to understand the ill effects of the weather parameters when they reach a value which is not beneficial to the crops and for minimizing the damage to the crops.  
2)The farmers also understand the limitations of the forecast such as quantity of rainfall, the uncertainity in the forecast, difficulty to meet their need of forecast one month in advance.
3)They were asked to contribute to minimize the green house gases and thus the climate change, by planting more trees, to go for conserving the runoff water in the form of Farm Pond and other soil and water conservation measures, by not burning the residues of the crops. Avoiding the Jhoom farming as done in Meghalaya which not only increases the temperature by cutting out the jungle but also kills the useful microbes thus reducing the crop production.


CONCLUSIONS: 
The increase in the population has led to increase in consumption of food.  Hence there is a lot of stress on farmers to provide more food in less time enough to cater to the needs of all.  A lot of efforts are being taken to minimize the loss of crops. One can only delay the sowing of crops in the event of forecast of non-rainy days. But one can only minimize the loss to already sown and standing crops. This can be achieved through awareness programmes for the farmers, interaction with stake holders and many other outreach programmes with one-to-one correspondence. Farmers should be advised suitably well in advance to plan their cropping pattern.
SMS are being sent to all registered farmers. Efforts should continue at mandal level by village panchayats so that more and more farmers willingly register to get the advisories in their local language free of cost. As per the feedback from farmers, the warnings/forecast should also be broadcast on television and AIR. These mediums should be more effectively used. A toll free service Kisan Call Centre should be in place to attend to all the queries of farmers and also to disseminate Agromet Advisories. These advisories should also be given in the newspaper.
Weekly agro advisory bulletin should be displayed in public places like Village office, Panchayat office and alike places and the bulletin should cover informations regarding animal husbandry, fisheries, mixed farming, organic farming and cool season vegetables. Also the likely attacks by the pest and diseases.
To combat the suicide of farmers in the event of crop failure, there should be formulation of strategy for risk management by using locally available natural resources and crop insurance scheme.
New varieties which can adapt to the climate change with less time to grow and with more productivity needs to be researched.
